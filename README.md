The Flaps API is up-to-date as of flyctl:d787a21fb3b1d2c99b7b6ab9ae5fabf855143240

Note that this crate is the default project version `0.1.0`. Fly.io's platform is a moving target, so strict semver compliance is unlikely.
Most changes will be issued as `0.1.x` releases, except for huge API differences.
